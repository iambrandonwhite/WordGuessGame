## Saturday Morning Cartoons - Word Guess Game
A Word Guess game with a Saturday Morning Cartoons theme. Click enter to begin the game. Input letters until you solve the puzzle. When you solve it, it tracks your wins and plays the theme music for that cartoon until you guess the next letter for the next puzzle. Also, tracks your losses if you don't solve the puzzle in less than 12 guesses.

## Motivation
Created during Week 3 of Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a word guess game. I decided to go with a 90s Cartoon Theme and designed the app with the 90s patterns and bright neon color. Bonus challenge was to add music whenever the user solved the puzzle.
